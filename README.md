A guide to data analysis when measuring Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivity on thin film samples using a cryogenic probe station.

## Background

### The Seebeck Effect

The Seebeck effect describes the generation of a voltage across a material when a temperature gradient is applied. This thermoelectric phenomenon is fundamental to applications such as thermoelectric generators and temperature sensors.

The **Seebeck coefficient** (S), also known as thermopower, quantifies this relationship:

```
S = ΔV / ΔT  [V/K or μV/K]
```

where:

- **ΔV** is the thermovoltage generated across the sample
- **ΔT** is the temperature difference across the sample

The sign of S indicates the dominant charge carrier type: negative for n-type (electrons) and positive for p-type (holes).

## The Measurement Challenge

Directly measuring the temperature difference (ΔT) across micron-scale thin films is impractical. Attaching thermocouples to such small features would perturb the thermal gradient and potentially damage the sample.

### Solution: Indirect Calibration

Instead of measuring ΔT directly, we use an indirect approach:

1. **Apply known heater power** (P) to create a temperature gradient
2. **Measure the resulting thermovoltage** (ΔV) → obtain **dV/dP**
3. **Calibrate separately** to determine temperature rise per unit power → obtain **dT/dP**
4. **Calculate Seebeck coefficient**: S = (dV/dP) ÷ (dT/dP)

This approach requires on-chip thermometer structures that can be calibrated against the known stage temperature.

## Measurement Setup

### Chip Geometry and Heat Flow

The on-chip test structure creates a vertical temperature gradient by positioning a resistive heater at one end of the sample. The entire chip sits on a cryogenic stage that acts as a heat sink, controlling the base temperature. When current flows through the heater, Joule heating raises the local temperature, and heat flows through the sample toward the cold stage. This establishes a temperature difference across the sample.

### On-Chip Components

The **heater** is a resistive metal stripe positioned near one edge of the sample. Passing current through it generates localised heating via Joule dissipation (P = I²R).

Two **resistive thermometers** are positioned near the source and drain stripes. The hot thermometer sits close to the heater and experiences a larger temperature rise. The cold thermometer sits further from the heater, closer to the heat-sunk stage, and remains nearer to the base temperature. Each thermometer consists of two probe pads on each end, enabling four-probe resistance measurement. In this configuration, current is passed through one pair of pads while voltage is measured across the other, eliminating contact resistance from the measurement—critical when detecting small resistance changes (typically < 1 Ω/K) and at low temperatures.

**Source and drain electrodes** contact the sample film and are used to measure the thermovoltage generated by the Seebeck effect, as well as the electrical conductivity.

### Physical Principle

The temperature at each thermometer position is determined from its resistance via the calibrated R(T) relationship. The temperature difference across the sample is ΔT = T_hot − T_cold. The thermovoltage measured between source and drain arises from the Seebeck effect acting across this temperature difference.

## Calibration Procedure

The thermometer stripes must be calibrated to convert resistance measurements into temperature values.

### Step 1: Measure R(P) at Each Temperature

At each stage temperature, apply a range of heater powers and record how the thermometer resistance changes. This captures the **dR/dP** relationship and enables calculation of R(T) baseline (by taking R at P=0).

### Step 2: Calculate dT/dP

Combining the calibration data:

```
dT/dP = (dR/dP) / (dR/dT)
```

where:

- **dR/dT** is obtained from the derivative of the R(T) baseline fit
- **dR/dP** is measured directly at each temperature

This gives the local temperature rise per unit heater power at both the hot and cold thermometer positions.

### Step 3: Calculate ΔT/P

The temperature difference across the sample per unit power is:

```
ΔT/P = (dT/dP)_hot − (dT/dP)_cold
```

This is the key calibration factor used to convert thermovoltage measurements into Seebeck coefficients.

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis proceeds in two parallel tracks that converge to yield the Seebeck coefficient.

**Calibration track**: First, the hot and cold thermometers are each calibrated independently. For each thermometer, at each stage temperature, the resistance change with heater power (dR/dP) is measured and the R(T) baseline relationship is established. Combining these gives dT/dP = (dR/dP) / (dR/dT) for each thermometer. The difference between the hot and cold thermometer values gives the net temperature difference per unit heater power: ΔT/P.

**Sample measurement track**: For the sample under test, the thermovoltage is measured as a function of heater power at each stage temperature, yielding dV/dP.

**Final calculation**: The Seebeck coefficient at each temperature is obtained by dividing the thermovoltage response by the calibrated temperature difference: S = (dV/dP) / (ΔT/P).

### Key Analysis Steps

At every step, check for and handle outliers before proceeding. Outliers most likely arise from poor tip/pad contact, and can propagate through the analysis if not addressed early.

1. **Fit dR/dP data** at each temperature for both thermometers. This should be a linear fit. Check for outliers in the raw dR/dP values.
2. **Fit R(T) data** to a polynomial to obtain a smooth baseline and its derivative dR/dT. Try polynomial orders 3 through 6 and select the order that best captures the physical behaviour, assessed by R² and residual inspection. The calibration temperature range is typically larger than the sample measurement range, so boundary effects are usually not a concern. Identify and exclude outliers before fitting.
3. **Compute dT/dP** for hot and cold sides using dT/dP = (dR/dP) / (dR/dT). Inspect the resulting values for anomalies.
4. **Subtract** to get the net ΔT/P across the sample. Flag any temperatures where ΔT/P is unexpectedly small, negative, or shows discontinuities.
5. **Thermovoltage** vs heater power for the sample → extract dV/dP.
6. **Divide** dV/dP by ΔT/P to obtain the Seebeck coefficient at each temperature. Since calibration and sample measurements may be at different temperature setpoints, interpolate ΔT/P onto the sample measurement temperatures before dividing. Check for outliers in the final Seebeck values.
7. **Analyse conductivity** data separately, again checking for outliers at each stage.
8. **Calculate power factor** (S² × σ) from the Seebeck coefficient and conductivity.

### Expected Outputs

The analysis should produce the following figures, each plotted as a function of temperature:

**Calibration figures (for both hot and cold thermometers):**

- R(T) — thermometer resistance vs temperature, with polynomial fit equation written out
- dR/dP(T) — resistance change per unit heater power, with polynomial fit equation written out
- dT/dP(T) — temperature rise per unit heater power, with equation written out

**Combined calibration:**

- ΔT/P(T) — net temperature difference per unit heater power across the sample

**Sample figures:**

- Thermovoltage vs heater power (or dV/dP vs T)
- Seebeck coefficient S(T)
- Electrical conductivity σ(T)
- Power factor S²σ(T)

## Practical Considerations

### Thermal Equilibration

Allow sufficient time at each temperature setpoint for the sample and stage to reach thermal equilibrium before taking measurements.

### Heater Power Range

Choose heater powers that produce measurable temperature gradients without:

- Exceeding the linear response regime
- Causing thermal damage to the sample
- Creating excessive temperature non-uniformity

### Data Quality

- **Outlier detection**: Check for outliers at every stage of the analysis. Common approaches include z-score filtering (flagging points beyond 2–3 standard deviations), interquartile range methods, or visual inspection of residuals. Outliers should be investigated (they may indicate real issues such as poor thermal contact or instrument glitches) and excluded if they cannot be explained. Document any points removed.
- **Polynomial fitting**: Test orders 3 through 6 for both R(T) and dR/dP(T) fits. Compare fits using R² values and visually inspect residuals for systematic deviations. Select the order that captures the physical behaviour without introducing unphysical oscillations.
- **Temperature interval alignment**: Calibration measurements and sample measurements may be taken at different temperature setpoints. Since these intervals may not align, interpolation of the calibration data (e.g., ΔT/P) onto the sample measurement temperatures is typically required before calculating the Seebeck coefficient.
